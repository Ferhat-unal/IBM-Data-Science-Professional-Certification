# About this Professional Certificate
Data Science is one of the hottest professions of the decade, and the demand for Data Scientists who can analyze data and communicate results to inform data driven decisions has never been greater. This Professional Certificate will help anyone interested in pursuing a career in **Data Science or Machine Learning** develop career-relevant skills.

It’s a myth that to become a data scientist you need a Ph.D. Anyone with a passion for learning can take this Professional Certificate – **no prior knowledge of computer science or programming languages required** – and develop the skills, tools, and portfolio to have a competitive edge in the job market as an entry level data scientist.

The program consists of 9 online courses (10 with the Python for Data Science course and the Python Project for Data Science being split up) that will provide you with the latest job-ready tools and skills, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, Data Visualization, Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Predictive Modeling, and Machine Learning algorithms. You’ll learn Data Science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

Completion of all the courses in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program will result in a complete portfolio of Data Science projects to provide you with the confidence to plunge into an exciting profession in Data Science.

In addition to earning a Professional Certificate from Coursera, you'll also receive a **digital badge from IBM** (and a digital badge for each course completed).

# Applied Learning Project
This Professional Certificate has a strong emphasis on applied learning. The courses include a series of hands-on labs in the IBM Cloud that give you **practical skills with applicability to real jobs**, including:

**Tools**: Jupyter / JupyterLab, GitHub, R Studio, and Watson Studio

**Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium, ipython-sql, Scikit-learn, ScipPy, etc.

**Projects**:

+ Extract and graph financial data with the Pandas Python library.
+ Use SQL to query census, crime, and school demographic datasets
+ Wrangle data, graph plots, and create regression models to predict housing prices with data science Python libraries.
+ Create a dynamic Python dashboard to monitor, report, and improve US domestic flight reliability.
+ Apply and compare machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.
+ Train and compare machine learning models to predict if a space launch can reuse the first stage of a rocket.
